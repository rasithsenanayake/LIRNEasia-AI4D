## Five Core Testing Personas

Use these personas to evaluate interfaces from different user perspectives. Select 2–3 relevant personas for each critique.

---

### Alex — Power User

**Profile**:
- Uses the product daily, multiple times
- Knows it well; has mental models and habits
- Values speed, efficiency, keyboard shortcuts
- Gets frustrated by repetition, extra clicks, no keyboard navigation

**Behaviors**:
- Skips onboarding (already knows the product)
- Uses keyboard shortcuts whenever possible
- Multi-tasks with multiple tabs or windows open
- Notices when something that worked before now works differently

**Test Questions**:
- Can I complete the primary flow in the minimum possible steps?
- Are there keyboard shortcuts for frequent actions?
- Does the interface respect my time or slow me down?
- Have recent changes broken my existing habits?

**Red Flags**:
- Required confirmation dialogs for routine actions
- No keyboard shortcuts for repeated tasks
- Mandatory onboarding that can't be skipped
- Important features buried two menus deep

### Jordan — First-Timer

**Profile**:
- Has never used this product before (or anything like it)
- Unfamiliar with domain terminology
- Relies entirely on the interface to guide them
- Makes decisions based on what's visible, not what's hidden

**Behaviors**:
- Reads labels carefully
- Pauses before clicking uncertain elements
- Looks for cues that indicate what's interactive
- Gives up quickly if confused or stuck

**Test Questions**:
- Does the product explain itself without a manual?

**Red Flags**:
- Technical jargon without explanation
- No clear call-to-action on first arrival
- Empty states without guidance
- Actions with non-obvious consequences
- No error messages that explain what went wrong

### Sam — Accessibility User

**Profile**:
- Uses a screen reader (VoiceOver, NVDA)

- Or has motor differences (uses switch control, large targets)

**Behaviors**:
- Navigates by Tab key
- Relies on ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Uses browser zoom to 200%
- May use voice control

**Test Questions**:
- Can I complete all primary tasks without a mouse?

- Are error messages announced to screen readers?

**Red Flags**:
- Focus indicator not visible (`:focus` styles removed)

### Riley — Stress Tester

**Profile**:
- Uses the product in difficult conditions
- Slow internet, old device, poor lighting, in a hurry

- Tests edge cases that product teams often miss

**Behaviors**:
- Submits forms with edge-case data
- Double-clicks buttons rapidly
- Navigates using browser back button
- Switches tabs mid-task
- Loses connection and returns

**Test Questions**:
- What happens when I submit an empty form?
- What happens when I enter 500 characters in a field expecting 50?
- What happens when I click a button twice quickly?
- What happens if my connection drops mid-upload?
- Does the back button do what I expect?

**Red Flags**:
- Duplicate form submissions on double-click
- No character limits shown (only enforced after submission)
- Generic error messages ("Something went wrong")

### Casey — Distracted Mobile

**Profile**:
- Using a phone on the go (commuting, holding something, multitasking)

**Behaviors**:

- Taps approximate locations (fat-finger problem)
- Leaves app and comes back later
- Gets notifications that interrupt flow

**Test Questions**:
- Can I complete the primary action with one hand?
- Do touch targets feel comfortable to hit?

- Does the page load on a slow connection?

**Red Flags**:

## Project-Specific Personas

For products with a documented user base, generate project-specific personas from the Design Context in `AGENTS.md`. These should supplement (not replace) the core 5 personas above.

A project-specific persona includes:
- Real job title and workflow context
- Specific goals within the product
- Known pain points from user research
- Primary device and environment
